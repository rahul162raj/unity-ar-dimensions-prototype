## Introduction
  
The purpose of this project is to construct a dynamic 3D model from 2D house plans by visualization of the model in real time using Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).
Visualize the 2D architectural drawings into 3D models dynamically into our real time environment using edge detection. OpenCV is used for the edge detection technology.
